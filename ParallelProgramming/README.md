### c++ and cuda implementations for some basic algorithmic task

* autocorrelation
* sorting
* image segmentation

Each problem is solved, preferably, with increasing speed/efficiency; I add vectorization, leverage branch prediction, add parallelism, use cache friendlier map's, and try using cuda.
